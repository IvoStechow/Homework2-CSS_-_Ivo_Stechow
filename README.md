Homework Two: Advanced Selectors and Display

The goal of this assignment is to provide additional practice styling a pre-existing website.  Your job is to modify some existing CSS rules and add new ones.  
Don't forget that this isn't your final site â€“  it's  just the second week and you will make additional changes in the coming weeks.


Objectives

Create a new version of your site from Homework One

Add a "Skip to Main Content" capability to each page

Remove some of the rules and apply new ones focusing on the general properties display, width, and list-style-type, as well as some of the supplemental properties such as grid-template-columns, flex-wrap,  justify-content, and/or align-items

Background

In this assignment you will create a copy of Homework One and then expand upon the concepts from your first assignment. 
Fork the code from your Styling a Page replit and modify both the html and the css files. 
Note, it is important that you create a new version of your code since your peers may still be grading your first homework assignment and need to see your original code. 
Here is a sneak peek of what we will be working on.  (Obviously I can't give you a link, otherwise you could see my style sheet!!)


Getting started

You will need to get the code to get started. 
Find your code from Homework One
Fork the code so that you have a new version.
When you peer grade, you can submit the link to your replit site.


Steps

Add a working "Skip to Main Content" link to each page by adding an id to the main tag and then adding an anchor (a tag) earlier in the file that will link to it.
Comment out the existing styling for the li element.
Change the nav element to use inline-block and have a width of about 80%.
Use a descendent selector to style only the image in the nav to have a width of about 10%. (If you want to make your site look a bit more like my screenshot, you can also add position: relative;  top: 20px; to the rule.
Style the grid class to use a two column grid where each column is approximately 40%.  Don't forget that to style a class element your selector should start with a period.
There is a good chance that your site will not look like mine. Use the descendent selector to style only the images in the grid class to have a width of 100%. (Check the parks page to make sure this change doesn't affect any images in the flex class.)   
Go back and adjust the grid class again. Play with the justify-content, align-items, and row-gap property values to copy the look of the screenshots above
Style the flex class to use flex. Play with the flex-wrap and justify-content property values to copy the look of the screenshots above.

Validate your code using https://wave.webaim.org/ or the wave browser extension.

Submit your link.

Complete three peer reviews.

When you are done you will share a link to your site so that you can receive peer reviews. 
In exchange, you will be completing peer reviews as well. 
Your peer review is a learning experience as well since it will allow you to see how different style sheets can drastically change the appearance of an html file. 
It may also expose you to new CSS properties and or values.
